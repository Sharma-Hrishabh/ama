# Ask me anything!

Hey :wave:
I'm Hrishabh, a Senior Undergraduate Student at the Computer Engineering Department, at NIT Surat, India.

I love to write '**neat**' C++, JS & Python code. So, if you want to discuss anything, I will be happy, just drop an [e-mail](mailto:hrishabh01sharma@gmail.com). But, don't ask my future plans in there.ðŸ¤¢

Apart from this, I have spent my past three-years in polishing my Software and Web Development skills and explored a lot in the field of DLTs.

With a great inclination towards understanding research work, I worked as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** at Computer Science & Engg. Department, **IIT Kharagpur** under the supervision of **Prof. Sandip Chakraborty** in Summers' 2019.

Following the same interest, I wanted to pursue a Summer Research Internship in 2020, but my offer got Passover due to pandemic.ðŸ˜› #gocorona

Sometimes missing an opportunity, actually makes room for opening new experiences, and I started committing to Open-Source, which lead me to the **Google Summer of Code 2020**, where I worked with **OpenSCAD**, a programmer's solid CAD 3D Modeller, under the BRLCAx Umbrella, as a Student Developer.

Looks like that, was enough to me. Still have some legitimate questions. Catch me on twitter [@_sharmahrishabh](https://twitter.com/_sharmahrishabh)

Apart from these professional interests, I am so obsessed with memes and also make some in free time ðŸ˜‰
